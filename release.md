I am proud to finally be able to announce that `FeathersJS Offline-first` has been released and it supports offline-first optimistic mutation for any CRUD adapter passing Feathers adapterTests - I my humble opinion this means Feathers is ready to be a serious contender for mobile solutions too.

For (synchronization) you can choose between the `own-data` or `own-net` strategies (excellently described in [offline-first](https://auk.docs.feathersjs.com/guides/offline-first/readme.html) and visualized by [simple-example](https://github.com/feathersjs-offline/simple-example)).

You will find the bits and pieces at GitHub [feathersjs-offline](https://github.com/feathersjs-offline) and NPM [server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@feathersjs-offline/server) and [client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@feathersjs-offline/client). Documentation at GitHubPages [FeathersJS-Offline](https://feathersjs-offline.github.io/docs).

Thanks to @daffl and @eddyystop for guidance and support. Frankly, I am in awe of what you guys and the rest of the team have accomplished! :tada: :100:

I hope you'll like it and find i useful. Ideas for improvement etc. are more than welcome.
