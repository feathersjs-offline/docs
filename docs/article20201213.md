# Introducing offline-first enablement for the Feathers framework
We are happy to share the release of [Feathers Offline-first own-data and own-net enablers](https://feathersjs-offline.github.io/docs) for **any CRUD adapter** in the Feathers family - what's more it is dead simple to use and enables any javascript developer to make mobile apps that actually work _also when not connected to the internet!_

Let's backtrack a little before revealing the what, when, and who.

## So what is Feathers anyway?
Feathers is a web-framework for creating real-time applications and REST APIs using JavaScript or TypeScript with Node.JS, React Native and the browser. It works with any backend supporting many databases out of the box and with any frontend technology like React, VueJS, Angular, Android or iOS.

Feathers acts as the API layer between any frontend and any backend
Feathers takes a different approach to both, traditional MVC frameworks like Rails, Sails or NestJS and low level HTTP frameworks like Sinatra, Express (with which Feathers is fully compatible), Hapi or Koa. Instead of creating routes, controllers or HTTP request and response handlers, Feathers uses services and workflows (hooks) that let you focus on your application logic independently from how it is being accessed.

This makes applications easier to understand and test and allows Feathers to automatically provide REST APIs, websocket real-time APIs (which [can often be quite a bit faster](https://blog.feathersjs.com/http-vs-websockets-a-performance-comparison-da2533f13a77)) and universal usage on the client and the server. It also makes it possible to add new communication protocols (like HTTP2 or GraphQL) without having to change anything in your application code. Feathers does all that while staying lightweight with a small API surface and codebase, and flexible by letting you use it with the backend and frontend technology that best suits your needs. You can read more about the high level concepts behind Feathers in [design patterns for modern web APIs](https://blog.feathersjs.com/design-patterns-for-modern-web-apis-1f046635215).

## Feathers Offline-first - what is it? :package:
In summary `own-data` / `own-net` are two related strategies implemented in [Feathers Offline-first](https://feathersjs-offline.github.io/docs). Both strategies queues CRUD events for a wrapped service locally until the device have connection to the server, but to the user the CRUD events are executed immediately using an optimistic mutation strategy.

`own-data` will re-play all queued event to the server in the order they were performed in offline mode. This allows the the server to react on each event (mutation). It may, for example, run [hooks](https://feathersjs-offline.github.io/docs/guides/basics/hooks.html) which send emails on certain mutations.

`own-net` on the other hand will only play the end result of all queued events for a given item (ie. row or document) to the server. If an item (document) is mutated 5 times only the result will reach the server when connection is established. If a record is patched and finally removed while still offline, the server will never see the mutations. The server may still react on each event (mutation), but bear in mind the changes are possibly only _net_ changes. `own-net` usually results in much shorter synchronization and reduced traffic between client and server.

You can read the original docs [here](https://auk.docs.feathersjs.com/guides/offline-first/readme.html) discussing the theories behind it all. The new and updated documentation is available [here](https://feathersjs-offline.github.io/docs).

## Feathers Offline-first - when to use it? :alarm_clock:
You should use [Feathers Offline-first](https://feathersjs-offline.github.io/docs) when you need your (mobile) application to continue to work when the user is not online. In essence, if you design your application carefully your users will have exactly the same experience offline as when they are online.

## Feathers Offline-first - who can use it? :family:
Anyone with basic JavaScript skills will be able to use [Feathers Offline-first](https://feathersjs-offline.github.io/docs) within an hour by following the guide in the documentation.

Any seasoned Feathers developer can take advantage of the `own-data` / `own-net` strategies within minutes as illustrated by these small snippets where we show the changes necessary to enable offline-first in an application generated with the Feathers application generator:

:::: tabs :options="{ useUrlFragment: false }"
::: tab "JavaScript (HTML)"
We need to add a couple of lines to `public/index.html`. First we show how to use the `own-data` wrapper:
``` html{16}
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport"
      content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0" />
    <title>FeathersJS chat</title>
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="//unpkg.com/feathers-chat@4.0.0/public/base.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="//unpkg.com/feathers-chat@4.0.0/public/chat.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app" class="flex flex-column"></div>
    <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.12.0/moment.js"></script>
    <script src="//unpkg.com/@feathersjs/client@^4.3.0/dist/feathers.js"></script>
    <script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
    <script src="//unpkg.com/@feathersjs-offline/client@^1.0/dist/feathersjs-offline-client.min.js"></script>
    <script src="client.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
In `client.js` we need to apply the wrapper like this:
``` js{7-8,10}
// ...

// Use localStorage to store our login token
client.configure(feathers.authentication());

// Wrap 'messages' to support the own-data offline-first principle
client.use('messages', memory());
feathersjsOfflineClient.owndataWrapper(client, 'messages', {});
// or if we connect to a service on at Feathers server
client.use('messages', feathersjsOfflineClient.Owndata({});

// ...
```

For `own-net` it's almost the same:
``` html{16}
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport"
      content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0" />
    <title>FeathersJS chat</title>
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="//unpkg.com/feathers-chat@4.0.0/public/base.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="//unpkg.com/feathers-chat@4.0.0/public/chat.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app" class="flex flex-column"></div>
    <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.12.0/moment.js"></script>
    <script src="//unpkg.com/@feathersjs/client@^4.3.0/dist/feathers.js"></script>
    <script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
    <script src="//unpkg.com/@feathersjs-offline/client@^1.0/dist/feathersjs-offline-client.min.js"></script>
    <script src="client.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
And of cause, in `client.js` we need to apply the wrapper like this:
``` js{7-8,10}
// ...

// Use localStorage to store our login token
client.configure(feathers.authentication());

// Wrap 'messages' to support the own-net offline-first principle
client.use('messages', memory());
feathersjsOfflineClient.ownnetWrapper(client, 'messages', {});
// or if we connect to a service on at Feathers server
client.use('messages', feathersjsOfflineClient.Ownnet({});


// ...
```

Here is a [link](#come-on-it-can-t-be-that-simple) to help you choose between `own-data` and `own-net`.


:::
::: tab "TypeScript"
``` js
// Sadly, the TypeScript version is not complete yet.
```
:::
::: tab "JavaScript (packager)"
We need to add a couple of lines to your file defining the service e.g. `app/app.js` (or whatever you choose). First we show how to use the `own-data` wrapper:
``` js{2,5}
// ...
import { owndataWrapper } from '@feathersjs-offline/client';
// ...
app.use('messages');
owndataWrapper(app, 'messages'); // Wrap the service; use the own-data principle
```
Next, this is how you use the `own-net` wrapper:
``` js{2,5}
// ...
import { ownnetWrapper } from '@feathersjs-offline/client';
// ...
app.use('messages');
ownnetWrapper(app, 'messages'); // Wrap the service; use the own-net principle
```

Here is a [link](https://feathersjs-offline.github.io/docs/guides/basics/offline-first.html#come-on-it-can-t-be-that-simple) to help you choose between `own-data` and `own-net`.

For the server we do this

:::: tabs :options="{ useUrlFragment: false }"
::: tab "JavaScript"
``` js{7}
// ...
import { realtimeWrapper } from '@feathersjs-offline/server';
// ...
app.use('messages', Messages());

// Wrap the service; supports both own-data/own-net principles
realtimeWrapper(app, 'messages', {});
```
:::
::: tab "TypeScript"
``` js
// Sadly, the TypeScript version is not complete yet.
```
:::

Hopefully you'll agree - it's simple! 3 lines in the clients code and 2 in the servers. Easy peasy.

## A final word
We trust you will find [Feathers Offline-first](https://feathersjs-offline.github.io/docs) interesting and you should give it a try - at the very least you should take [Feathers](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers) for a spin - you will love it!
